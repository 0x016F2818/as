GPIO&PINCTRL - General Purpose Input Output and Pin mode control system

This is a very important part to most of the embeded system as we need IO pins to do some controls of the exeternal world. By the last post [aslinux-dts-study](http://parai.github.io/as/linux/2016/02/20/aslinux-dts-study.html), I think I have already known the basic points of the device tree system. So I think it would be much better if I can develop one driver with DTS, and I think GPIO driver is a very good entry point. But as I have no real board, so I choose use QEMU vexpress-a9 as a simulation platform, let's start now.

1. New file [kernel/drivers/pinctrl/pinctrl-asvirt.c](https://github.com/parai/as/blob/b75f6b010f775aa4e6a058dfb0ffabc921abb566/release/aslinux/kernel/drivers/pinctrl/pinctrl-asvirt.c)

2. New a simple DTS [kernel/arch/arm/boot/dts/vexpress-v2p-asvirt.dtsi](https://github.com/parai/as/blob/b75f6b010f775aa4e6a058dfb0ffabc921abb566/release/aslinux/kernel/arch/arm/boot/dts/vexpress-v2p-asvirt.dtsi)

3. apply the patch below

There is something wrong the driver register API is not called, by debug with QEMU with eclipse, it founds out that the printk message doesn't goes out directly, but with command dmesg, I can see the debug information, but I already set the loglevel to 7, the lowest, but it still not work. so who cares, let's use pr_debug.

So then on, take the pinctrl-sirf.c as an example. so almost copy the content of pinctrl-sirf, make the build pass, so according the content of dtsi, 3 pinctrl devices will be created and driver pinctrl-asvirt will be probed 3 times, this is a very small step forware, but also a big step, so let's go on to know how to fill the API up to make the virtual pinctrl driver works.

During the filling up of the driver API, I think the pinctrl-sirf is a mess, very ugly, but looking into the code of pinctrl-st, the driver seems to be very simple, but the dts is missing in the release package, okay, go on with the sirf, I think it was that the hardware is a mess.


okay, till 2016-7-3 12:09, it was done almost for all of the API, and I think I know some basic things of PINCTRL, okay, then I need to research how the API was called by other drivers or APP, below is the code now:

* [kernel/drivers/pinctrl/pinctrl-asvirt.c](https://github.com/parai/as/blob/22683e54839962571d4ae9e03fda315c00b212dd/release/aslinux/kernel/drivers/pinctrl/pinctrl-asvirt.c)

* [kernel/arch/arm/boot/dts/vexpress-v2p-asvirt.dtsi](https://github.com/parai/as/blob/22683e54839962571d4ae9e03fda315c00b212dd/release/aslinux/kernel/arch/arm/boot/dts/vexpress-v2p-asvirt.dtsi)

[2016-8-1] from rpmsg back to pinctrl, so I want to know how a group of pins are used by differnet drivers such as CAN driver.
