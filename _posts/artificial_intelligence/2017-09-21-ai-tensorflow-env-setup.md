## [tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow) - what it is

okay, no need to talk much about it as it was a famous open source artificial intelligence software invented by google.

## tensorflow - how to setup

It's really not good as in china we have been limited by the party so we can't access some resources outside the big firewall, yes we can use VPN, so follow the [install guide](http://wiki.jikexueyuan.com/project/tensorflow-zh/get_started/os_setup.html), and the way to install through [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) is the best way, luckily Anaconda was accessable even without VPN.

## tensorflow - an example do object detection

This [object detection model](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/object_detection) is really a good start point to have a try of tensorflow to see what it can do, it's very good. Also there are many other models that could do really a lot of things, I am planing to try them one by one if possible.

For the tool [protoc](https://github.com/google/protobuf), if ubuntu just use apt-get to install the necessary version, if win, download it from the [github](https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases/tag/v2.6.1).
