Nowdays, [yocto](https://www.yoctoproject.org/) has becomes very famous for liunx based system distribution, below is an introduction from the net.

The Yocto Project is an open source collaboration project that provides templates, tools and methods to help you create custom Linux-based systems for embedded products regardless of the hardware architecture. It was founded in 2010 as a collaboration among many hardware manufacturers, open-source operating systems vendors, and electronics companies to bring some order to the chaos of embedded Linux development.

so I want to learn something about it and build the aslinux, okay, I think the best way is to study step by step, so let's start from the dizzy branch as it was used by my current company.

```sh
git clone -b dizzy git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky.git 
```
