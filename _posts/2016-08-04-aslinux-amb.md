## [AMB](https://github.com/otcshare/automotive-message-broker) is part of [AGL](https://www.automotivelinux.org/)

Automotive Message Broker is a vehicle network abstraction system. It brokers information from the vehicle to applications. It provides application with a rich API for accessing vehicle data.
