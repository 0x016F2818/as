# c language software component

* Can

This is vxlapi CAN access wrapper in C language,  it is much more simple than using vxlapi directly.

* FreeRTOS

For application, whatever it is, an OS is needed, whether it is RTOS or just simple scheduler. 


#### What I should study?

Till now, I think I already know well about RTOS/CAN/NVM/COM/DCM, but I still have very limited knowledge about embedded GUI. so I think I should learn something about it.What is font and what is image and what is animation?

* Lcd

lower layer to simulate a fixed size LCD displayer on FreeRTOS
